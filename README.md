# GMMandKMeans
K-means algorithm and the Expectation-Maximization algorithm using Gaussian Mixture Model (GMM)
Implement the K-means algorithm AND the Expectation Maximization algorithm for clustering using a Gaussian Mixture Model (GMM). 
Run algorithms on the data file "clusters.txt" using K, the number of clusters, set to 3. 
Report the centroid of each cluster in K-means; and report the mean, amplitude and covariance matrix of each Gaussian in GMM. 
Compare the results of the two algorithms. 
The data file contains 150 2D points. 
Each row in the file contains the coordinates of a single point. 

The source code file is: KmeansGMM.py

The detail discussion of algorithm, implementation and library function please see the Kmeans_and_GMMreport.pdf.
